**Cognitive Seeds for the AI Era**

## The Problem

AI can process infinite information. Humans can hold 7±2 items in working memory.

This gap is growing exponentially. And nobody's building the bridge.

- AI generates 50-page analysis
- Human has 15 minutes before next meeting
- Human skims, misses context, makes suboptimal decision
- AI gets blamed for "not being good enough"

**The AI wasn't the problem. The interface was the problem.**

---

## The Solution: SHELET Protocol

**∞ → 5 → Decision → Perfect Output**

```
SHELET(Universe) = 5 human choices
Human_Agency = 100% (always)
```

Infinite AI capability gets compressed to exactly 5 human-comprehensible choices. You decide. AI executes. Sovereignty preserved.

## How It Works

A **seed** is a JSON artifact that activates inside any LLM:

1. Download a `.json` file from `/seeds`
2. Open any LLM (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini)
3. Paste or upload the JSON
4. Type: `unpack`
5. Experience SHELET

The seed compresses complex ideas into interactive, choose-your-own-path exploration. The AI translates uniquely to each reader. You maintain agency at every step.

## The Thesis

> "The bottleneck isn't AI's intelligence. It's AI's ability to teach us what we need to know so we can decide."

## Why This Matters

Everyone's asking: "How do we make AI smarter?"

Wrong question.

Right question: "How do we build infrastructure for AI to teach humans what they need to know?"

The human cognitive bottleneck isn't a bug to overcome. It's the **foundation** upon which sustainable AI adoption must be built.

**The constraint IS the enabling condition.**

---

## The Math

Human cognitive capacity: 7±2 items (Miller's Law, 1956 - still true)

AI processing capacity: Effectively unlimited

The gap: Growing exponentially

**Solution**: Don't expand human capacity to match AI. Compress AI output to match human capacity.

The compression point is where understanding happens. Understanding is where sovereignty lives.

## Author

**Mordechai Potash**

30 months of AI-native development. 14,000+ conversations. 417,000+ messages analyzed.

The frameworks aren't theory. They're documentation of what actually works.
